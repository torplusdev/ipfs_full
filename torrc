# Below is the refernece tor configuration for torplus.
# This is client configuration with several fields that can be optionally enabled for server deployment
# Important: By default tor runs without console output, to enable console operation please set TOR_PLUS_CMD env variable to 1 before running tor.
# Generally it's a good idea to set TOR_PLUS_CMD to 1 in profile startup script for development machines.
# To run tor with local torrc file, run ./tor -f torrc otherwise it may pick up another file in a standard location.




# The folder below need to be located on the machine, usually in the installation folder
# Below is the windows location, adapt for your OS.
DataDirectory C:\Users\Michael\Desktop\Tor Browser\Browser\TorBrowser\Data\Tor

# Specify that we aren't using production parameters for tor.
# This sets different values for many different parameters, and that's how we currently use it with torplus.
# More info on what's configured is here: https://manpages.debian.org/testing/tor/tor.1.en.html#TESTING_NETWORK_OPTIONS
